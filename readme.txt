You are not permitted to resell or redistribute (even for free) the resource "as is" without prior consent. If you would like to republish or promote this resource on your site, please link back to the appropriate resource page on styleshout.com where users can find the download and not directly to the download zip file. You must include a credit link to our website (https://www.styleshout.com) somewhere on your site.

REMOVING THE ATTRIBUTION LINK: We understand that there are situations where you want to use our templates without the crediting obligation. If that's your case, you can always send us a credit removal fee of 10 USD through Paypal. This will allow you to use a single template attribution/credit link free on ONE DOMAIN name. You can send your payments through Paypal to this address: ealigam@gmail.com or visit our attribution removal page: https://www.styleshout.com/attribution-free/ and click the pay button on the page. If possible, kindly send us the site's URL where the template is being used. Also, keep your Paypal receipt as proof of payment, and youâ€™re good to go.

SUPPORT: Since PRATIK is distributed for free, support is not offered. PRATIK is coded according to current web standards, and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify. If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. However, if you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the following tutorials: https://marksheet.io/ and http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/. These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include JavaScript in your skill set, you can also check out these tutorials: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript and https://javascript.info/.

USING THE MAILCHIMP FORM: To use the Mailchimp form, you need a Mailchimp URL. To get the Mailchimp URL, log in to your Mailchimp account, click the Audience menu, and select signup forms. Then choose embedded forms and select the unstyled form. In the generated form code, get the value of the form ACTION attribute and use it as your Mailchimp URL. Open the main.js file located in the template's "js" folder and look for this line of code: const cfg = { // MailChimp URL mailChimpURL: 'https://facebook.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=1abf75f6981256963a47d197a&amp;id=37c6d8f4d6' }; Replace the value of mailChimpURL with your Mailchimp URL.

GET THE LATEST VERSION: We update our templates on a regular basis, so to make sure that you have the latest version, always download the template files directly from our website (https://www.styleshout.com/).
